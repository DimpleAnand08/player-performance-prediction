# Player Performance Prediction

This project simulates gameplay data and builds a machine learning model to predict whether a player will win or lose based on performance metrics like level, time played, and actions per minute.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Simulated game data
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and ML model
- `src/`: Future model script
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ML Model
RandomForestClassifier used to classify player outcome (win/loss). Achieved ~90% accuracy on test set.
